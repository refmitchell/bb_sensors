/**

   \brief Implementation of the POL_OP wrapper class for reading the polarisation 
          opponent PCBs.

   The polarisation opponent PCBs contain two analogue-to-digital converters
   which can be read directly, however, this class was constructed to abstract
   this process to a 'polarisation opponent unit' or POL_OP.

   See POL_OP class documentation.

   \note The ADC we use is the ADS112C04 by Texas Instruments. The
   library for the ADC was adapted from a previous Arduino library for
   the ADS122C04 (112 vs. 122). As a result, the device is erroneously
   called the ADS122C04 throughout the code. I was not able to fix
   this without introducing major changes (which invariably introduce
   major bugs); I was worried about breaking something which I then
   wouldn't have time to test. Please be aware of this difference
   if you plan to modify any of the I2C libraries for this device!
